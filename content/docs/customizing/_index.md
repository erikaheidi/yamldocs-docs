There are multiple ways in which you can customize the docs generated by Yamldocs. For simple layout / template customizations, such as adding an image or block of default text, you can [create custom templates](/docs/customizing/custom-templates/) to overwrite the default ones used by Yamldocs.
This is also useful to [generate content for Hugo websites](/docs/customizing/custom-templates/#generating-content-for-hugo-websites) and other static site generators based on markdown.

If you need a more fine-grained customization, you can [create a custom builder](/docs/customizing/custom-builders/) to interact directly with your YAML content. This requires some familiarity with PHP development, since you'll need to create a class that implements a builder interface.
