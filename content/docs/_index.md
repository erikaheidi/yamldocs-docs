Yamldocs is a markdown document generator based on YAML files, written in PHP with [Minicli](https://minicli.dev). It can be used as a standalone app or included as a Composer bin command to be used within existing projects. It is mostly useful to create automated reference docs and comparison tables that can be customized through templates and a common builder interface.

Check out the [Getting Started Guide]() for more information on how to use it.
